# **Threads Bullshit Blocker üõ°Ô∏è**

A Chrome extension that detects and flags Frankfurt-style bullshit on Threads.net. Based on the philosophical work of Harry Frankfurt, this tool helps you identify content that disregards the truth, not just content that is factually incorrect.

## **What is Frankfurt-Style Bullshit?**

In his essay "On Bullshit," philosopher Harry Frankfurt draws a distinction between lying and bullshitting.

* A **liar** knows the truth but deliberately tries to conceal it.  
* A **bullshitter** doesn't care what the truth is. They are only interested in creating a certain impression.

This extension is designed to detect the latter: language that is evasive, manipulative, and indifferent to the truth.

## **Features**

* **üîé Real-Time Analysis**: Scans posts on Threads.net as you browse.  
* **üìä BS Score**: Each post is given a "Bullshit Score" based on an analysis of its content.  
* **üö© Flagging System**: Posts that exceed a certain BS threshold are flagged with a clear warning.  
* **üéöÔ∏è Adjustable Sensitivity**: You can adjust the detection sensitivity in the extension's popup menu.  
* **üîí Privacy-Focused**: All analysis is done locally in your browser. No data is ever sent to a server.

## **How It Works**

The extension analyzes the text of each post on Threads against a comprehensive dictionary of words and phrases categorized by different types of bullshit, including:

* **Hedging Words**: Language that avoids making direct claims.  
* **Vague Authority Appeals**: Citing "experts" or "studies" without specifics.  
* **Empty Intensifiers**: Words that add emotion but not substance.  
* **Buzzword Soup**: Using jargon to sound impressive without saying anything.  
* ...and 11 other categories\!
